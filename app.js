// 1) I want to make the user enter the username and then start the game by clicking on a button which stores the username and uses it during the game

// a) Create an event listener for "startGameBtn" that listens for clicks and runs a function called "storeUsername".
// b) Inside the "storeUsername" function:
// Take the value from the "usernameInput" field and store it in a variable called "username".
// If no username is entered, show an alert asking the user to input a name.
// Display the username in the "messageDisplay" area and call the "startGame" function to begin the game.
